# Vinci Protocol

This repository contains the smart contracts source code for Vinci Protocol. The repository uses Hardhat as development enviroment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## Getting Started

Run the following command to initialize the environment:

`npm run initenv`

And to test:

`npm run test`

Sometimes it will report an error like this:

`Error: Cannot find module './test-suites/__setup.spec.ts'`

It's not an error. You could just ignore it. The result of the test run is above that line.
